The Ghostery Lite app extension for the Safari desktop browser works alongside Apple’s new privacy ecosystem to bring Safari users comprehensive privacy protection. Check page performance, pause Ghostery Lite, trust a site and switch to your custom settings with a single click.

This project consists of three main components:

+ GhosteryLite: Native macOS container application that manages user settings and controls the Safari extensions
+ SafariExtension: UI Toolbar extension in Safari
+ ContentBlocker:  Content blocking extension in Safari
